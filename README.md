# FollowSpot

**Hackbright Capstone Project**

FollowSpot is an application that allows entertainment industry professionals to easily log and track their audition appointments and materials. 
When it comes to audition tracking, here’s what you’ll want to note: date of audition, type of audition, company you’re auditioning for, role and piece you’re auditioning for, who the casting director is, who was in the room, what you wore/makeup/hair, what happened in the room, how you felt about what you did in the room. This provides you with hard data you can track, it shows where you’re being consistent and competitive, and what needs work, all of which will set you up for the most success.

## Features
- Allow the user to create an account to store all of their audition information and materials
- Complies all the information and displays it cleanly on a timeline feed

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python3, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, Bash
- **APIs:** Twilio, Cloudinary, Cronofy
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap



### Why FollowSpot?
I developed this project at Hackbright Academy for my solo capstone project.

My project incorporates everything I’ve learned about full-stack web development in the first 6 weeks of my software engineering fellowship at Hackbright.
