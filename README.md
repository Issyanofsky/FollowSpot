FollowSpot is an application that allows entertainment industry professionals to easily log and track their audition appointments and materials. 
When it comes to audition tracking, here’s what you’ll want to note: date of audition, type of audition, company you’re auditioning for, role and piece you’re auditioning for, who the casting director is, who was in the room, what you wore/makeup/hair, what happened in the room, how you felt about what you did in the room. This provides you with hard data you can track, it shows where you’re being consistent and competitive, and what needs work, all of which will set you up for the most success. Audition tracking can help you be most competitive, accountable, refine your package, and set you up for success by collecting hard data. At the end of every week, look back at your notes to see what did or didn’t work. Add your findings to your to-do list and work on them! This will help you be your awesome self and allow your light to always shine.
